<h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Fettuccini noodle</li>
        <li>Butter </li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Assorted household spices</li>

    </ul>
<h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>First things first. Get your water
            boiling for your noodles. This is generally
            the most time consuming part of the whole recipe.
        </li>
        <li>While your noodles boil heat a sauce pan and add
            your butter and garlic.
        </li>
        <li> When the butter has melted, slowly add the 
            heavy whipping cream.
        </li>
        <li> Let the sauce cook on medium high heat until 
            the cream is warm.
        </li>
        <li>Add parmesan to the warmed cream. It is easier
            to add small amounts at a time, letting
            the previous amount melt before adding more.
        </li>
        <li>Stop adding cheese when the sauce is at a 
            thickness that suits you. If the sauce is too thin
            add more cheese, if the sauce is too thick add 
            more cream.
        </li>
        <li>While the sauce is cooking and combining flavors,
            add pepper to taste. The cheese adds a fairly large
            amount of salt to the dish. Be sure to give your
            sauce a taste and add additional flavors as desired.
        </li>
        <li>Drain your noodles and return them to your
            pot. Cover with the sauce and stir thoroughly.
        </li>
        <li>ENJOY!!!</li>
