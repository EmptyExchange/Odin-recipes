        <p>Chicken Fried Steak takes a little more time
            than the other quick recipes found here,
            but it is definitly worth the time if you are 
            in the mood for some great comfort food.
        </p>
        <p>This recipe is only for the steak itself.
            There are many great recipes and even some 
            easy store bought mixes for the gravy. 
            
        </p>
        <p>Additionally this recipe pairs very well with 
            many different side dishes. If you are looking 
            to really hit that comfort food spot I suggest
            adding some scalloped or mashed potatos to 
            really knock you into food bliss!

            </li>
            <li>Head oil in a frying pan, enough to cover

            </li>
            <li>Season the flour generously with pepper,
                salt, garlic powder, and your choice of
